# GifTastic

**Overview:** Using the GIPHY API, JavaSript and jQuery, I created a dynamic webpage that populates gifs of your choosing. However, try to stick with the theme: DOGS!

**Link to GIPHY Project:** https://ckayv11.github.io/GifTastic/

**Instructions:**
 1. Click on any button to populate 10 gifs for that named button
 2. Then click on any image to play the gif
 3. Click on the image again to pause the gif
 4. You can also type any dog you'd like in the form provided & hit Submit to render a new button for your input
 5. Play around with the buttons or form to populate a new set of gifs at the top
 6. Swoon over how adorable the gifs are!

## Thanks for visiting and enjoy the pups! ##
